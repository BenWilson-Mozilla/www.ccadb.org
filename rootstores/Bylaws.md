# DRAFT Bylaws of the CCADB

# 1.    Mission and Scope

## 1.1  Purpose and Mission Statement

The Common CA Database (CCADB) is a repository of information about Certification Authorities (CAs) whose root and intermediate certificates are included within the products and services of Root Store Operators (CCADB “Members”) who participate in the CCADB to improve security, transparency, and interoperability.

## 1.2  Scope of Activities

The CCADB Steering Committee (“Steering Committee”) determines collectively the direction and priorities for the CCADB and shares the workload associated with running the CCADB, including CA program management and the design and testing of updates to the CCADB. 

The historic goal of all CCADB activities has been to communicate openly and to seek substantial consensus among Members before proceeding or adopting a final work product, and this goal will remain for the future.

## 1.3  CCADB Charter

In the event of inconsistency between these Bylaws and the CCADB Charter, the CCADB Charter takes precedence.


# 2.    Membership

## 5.1  Official Communication Channels

The CCADB Steering Committee shall maintain mailing lists and a public website. 

The CCADB Public Mailing List is located here:[ ](https://groups.google.com/a/ccadb.org/g/public)https://groups.google.com/a/ccadb.org/g/public.

As stated here: https://www.ccadb.org/cas/public-group.

The Code of Conduct for the CCADB Public Mailing List is located here: [ ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19ALqEvHtTE6OUTz2FaOXrU9gruIdvia5EDh3hXeGpZA/)https://docs.google.com/document/d/19ALqEvHtTE6OUTz2FaOXrU9gruIdvia5EDh3hXeGpZA/

## 5.2  Steering Committee Communications

There is a Steering Committee mailing list established to facilitate communication among Steering Committee Representatives concerning CCADB-related matters. Steering Committee Representatives are discouraged from forwarding, sharing, or re-posting such communications outside the group without the permission of the author or commenter.

# 6.    Voting and Other Forms of Decision-making

## 6.1  Decision-making Processes

The Steering Committee may use electronic mail, meetings, or any other means to discuss any issue or action that comes before the Steering Committee.

Decisions will be made by consensus (three-fifths majority) of the Steering Committee Representatives, except when the Procedure for Formal Ballots is requested by a Member or required by these Bylaws. Consensus may be established tacitly. By way of example, so long as (1) proposed actions are clear and visible, (2) participants have opportunities to voice concerns, and (3) there is no sustained, substantive opposition, then consensus may be established simply by moving forward on the proposal or a course of action; this is anticipated to be the norm for most matters. 

The Steering Committee may, without a meeting, use email or other electronic means to take action (e.g. vote, change the public website, update the CCADB) that is allowed by law. Before taking the action, a Steering Committee Representative shall send an announcement to the Steering Committee Email List stating (i) that the Steering Committee will take the action, (ii) a description of the matter on which the Steering Committee will take action, and (iii) a deadline of not less than 48 hours after the time the Steering Committee sends the announcement in which any Steering Committee Representative may voice concern or opposition to the proposed action. After the deadline, the Steering Committee may take the action only when the concerns and opposition have been resolved.

Upon request by a Steering Committee Representative (or upon request by a Member) a decision, issue, or proposed action may be decided using the Procedure for Formal Ballots.

## 6.2  Procedure for Formal Ballots

The following rules apply to Formal Ballots:

### 6.2.1. One Vote
Only one vote per Member organization made by a designated Steering Committee Representative or their Alternate shall be accepted.

### 6.2.2. Discussion Period
Any Steering Committee Representative or their Alternate can call for a proposed ballot to be published for discussion and comment by Members. The discussion period then shall take place for at least seven (7) calendar days before votes are cast. At any time, a new version of the ballot (marked with a distinguishing version number) may be posted (by sending email to the Steering Committee Email List) by the proposer in the same manner as the original. Once no new version of the ballot has been posted for seven (7) calendar days, the proposer may end the discussion period and start the voting period by reposting the final version of the ballot and clearly indicating that voting is to begin, along with the start and end dates and times (including time zone) for the voting period. The ballot automatically fails if ninety (90) calendar days elapse after the proposer last posted a version of the ballot and the voting period has not been started.

### 6.2.3 Redline Version
A ballot may include a redline or comparison showing the set of changes from those sections intended to be amended, and need not include a copy of the document. Such redline or comparison shall be made against those section(s) as they exist at the time a ballot is proposed, and need not take into consideration other ballots that may be proposed subsequently. In the event of a conflict between the text presented in the ballot (the “Ballot Version”) and the text in the redline/comparison copy (the “Redline Version”), the Ballot Version shall in all cases take precedence over the Redline Version. If present, the Ballot Version shall be the official text used for implementation should the ballot pass. If a discrepancy between the Redline Version and the Ballot Version is discovered during the discussion or voting periods, a corrected copy of the Redline Version shall be submitted to the Steering Committee Email List for reference; this corrected Redline Version shall not affect the Ballot Version, the discussion period, or the voting period.

### 6.2.4. Voting Period
Upon commencement of the voting period, Members shall have exactly seven (7) calendar days for voting on the proposed ballot, with the deadline clearly communicated in the ballot and sent to the Steering Committee Email List. A proposer may withdraw a ballot at any point during the voting period. All voting will take place via the Steering Committee Email List. Votes must be submitted by a Steering Committee Representative to such list by the end of the voting period (as specified in the ballot) to be considered valid and counted. Each Member, and not the Steering Committee, will be responsible for taking precautions to make sure such Member's vote is submitted properly and counted. In the event that a Member’s vote on a ballot is not submitted properly, such vote shall not be valid and shall not be counted for any purpose, and there shall be no appeal, re-vote (except in the case of a new ballot submitted to all Members) or other recourse.

### 6.2.5. Voting Criteria for Adoption
In order for a ballot to be adopted, the quorum requirements must be met, and three-fifths (3/5) or more of the votes cast by the Members must be in favor of the ballot. Members may vote “yes”, “no”, or “abstain” on a ballot. Only votes that indicate a clear “yes” or “no” response to the ballot question shall be considered (i.e. votes to “abstain” and votes that do not indicate a clear “yes” or “no” response will not figure into calculations). 

### 6.2.6. Tabulation and Announcement of Results
The Chairperson will tabulate and announce the results (by sending email to the Steering Committee Email List) within eight (8) business days of the close of the voting period. The Chairperson may delegate these duties as necessary.

## 6.3  Quorum Requirements

Quorum for Steering Committee and Committee meetings will require at least fifty percent of the Representatives or their Alternates. If advance notice of the meeting has been given per normal means and timing, the Steering Committee may continue to meet even if quorum is not met, but will be prevented from making any decisions at the meeting.

Presence for quorum may be achieved electronically – through email (for voting) or during virtual teleconferencing, in which representatives can participate in real-time discussions. Physical in-person presence is not required. In the event that the number of Members present falls below quorum during a meeting, the Steering Committee shall not take any further official action until quorum is reestablished.

# 8.    Conflict of Interest Policy

## 8.1  Definition of Conflict of Interest

As used in this section, a “conflict of interest transaction” is a transaction involving the CCADB in which a Steering Committee Representative or an Alternate has a direct or indirect interest. A Representative/Alternate has an indirect interest in a transaction if (i) another entity in which the Representative/Alternate has a material interest is a party to the transaction; (ii) another entity of which the Representative/Alternate is a director, officer or trustee is a party to the transaction; or (iii) a person who is related to the Representative/Alternate or a business associate of the Representative/Alternate is a party to the transaction.

## 8.2  Approval

A conflict of interest transaction is not voidable or the basis for imposing liability on the Steering Committee Representative/Alternate if the transaction is fair to the organization at the time it was entered into or is approved either (i) in advance by the vote of the Steering Committee if the material facts of the transaction and the Representative’s/Alternate’s interest were disclosed or known to the Steering Committee, or (ii) if the material facts of the transactions and the Representative’s/Alternate’s interest were disclosed or known to the Steering Committee and the Steering Committee authorized, approved or ratified the transaction. A conflict of interest transaction is so authorized, approved or ratified by the Steering Committee if it receives the affirmative vote of a three-fifths majority of the Steering Committee Representatives on the Steering Committee who have no direct or indirect interest in the transaction; provided that a transaction may not be so authorized, approved or ratified by a single person. If a majority of the Steering Committee Representatives who have no direct or indirect interest in the transaction votes to authorize, approve or ratify the transaction, a quorum is present for the purpose of taking such action.

## 8.3  Disclosure Procedures

Steering Committee Representatives and Alternates are required to disclose any potential conflicts of interest promptly and completely. Any disclosure of any ongoing conflict of interest must be updated if there is a change in circumstances.

## 8.4  Recusal and Management

A Steering Committee Representative or Alternate shall notify the Chairperson of any potential conflict of interest and recuse themselves from decision-making processes and abstain from discussions and voting in situations where conflicts of interest exist. If necessary, an alternate decision-maker shall be appointed by the Member in the event of recusal.

## 8.5  Additional Conflict of Interest Rules

The Steering Committee may establish a policy that contains additional rules, requirements, and procedures for resolving or avoiding conflicts of interest.

# 9.  Officers

The Steering Committee currently has two officers, Chairperson and Treasurer. Both the Chairperson and Treasurer must be Steering Committee Representatives.

## 9.1  Term of Office

There is no limit to how long the Chairperson or Treasurer may remain in such role, as long as they are continuously a Steering Committee Representative and upholding these Bylaws. An officer may step down from their role at any time, but preferably with 2 weeks’ notice to the Steering Committee. If it is found that an officer is not complying with these Bylaws, then the Steering Committee may select a new officer via a three-fifths majority vote.

## 9.2   Chairperson

The Chairperson shall exercise their functions in a fair and neutral manner, allowing all Members equal treatment for their comments and proposals, and shall not favor one side over another in any matter (except that the Chairperson may indicate their own position during discussion and voting on the matter). The Chairperson shall have no personal liability for any activities of the CCADB or its Members, Representatives, or Alternates.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the CCADB Steering Committee will provide a Member with reasonable assistance, where practicable, to allow the Member to migrate its data from the CCADB.

# 14.  Prohibition on Political Activities

No political or lobbying expenditure shall be made which might result in the loss of, or otherwise adversely affect, this organization’s status as a tax-exempt organization under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.

# 15.  Antitrust Policy

The goal of CCADB Steering Committee activities has been to seek substantial consensus among Members before proceeding or adopting final work product, and this goal will remain for the future. Members shall not use their participation in the CCADB either to promote their own products and offerings or to restrict or impede the products and offerings of other Members.

CCADB meetings and communications include companies that compete against one another. These meetings and communications are intended to discuss, improve, and use the CCADB without restricting competition. CCADB meetings and communications are not intended to share competitively-sensitive information among competitors, and therefore all participants agree not to discuss or exchange information related to:

1. Pricing policies, pricing formulas, prices or other terms of sale;
2. Costs, cost     structures, profit margins,
3. Pending or     planned service offerings,
4. Customers,     business, or marketing plans; or
5. The allocation of customers, territories, or products in any way.

All CCADB Steering Committee Representatives must comply with these Bylaws, this antitrust statement, and the [Code of Conduct](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BeP7YJVJlRzXTwDm9r_VJhsuhQ_1tj0g7fDbdk6zk4k/edit?usp=sharing).

Members should contact the Chairperson with any concerns relating to these Bylaws, this antitrust statement, and the [Code of Conduct](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BeP7YJVJlRzXTwDm9r_VJhsuhQ_1tj0g7fDbdk6zk4k/edit?usp=sharing).

# 16.  Property Rights

Members may develop customizations of the CCADB for their own use and submit them for inclusion into the CCADB.

Any data or other content uploaded to the CCADB and any suggestion, enhancement request, recommendation, correction or other feedback provided to the CCADB Steering Committee relating to the CCADB shall not include any confidential or proprietary information, and it (excepting personally identifiable information) may be used, copied, stored, disclosed or otherwise exploited by the CRM Service Provider, the Backup Service Provider, and any other participant in the CCADB and the public, without restriction or any form of compensation to such disclosing party.

Except as provided in these Bylaws, no Member shall have any right or interest in any of the property or assets of the CCADB, except for rights retained in any contributed works, but only to the extent permitted by any policy relating to intellectual property rights approved by the CCADB Steering Committee as then in force.

# 17.  Effective Date and Amendments
