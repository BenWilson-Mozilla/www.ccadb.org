## CCADB Root Store Operator Usage Terms ##
As permitted by the [Bylaws of the CCADB](Bylaws.md), 
and in addition to any other requirements set out 
therein, the CCADB Steering Committee sets some usage terms and rules for using 
the CCADB, as follows.

### Meetings ###

Root Store Operators (Members) of the CCADB may meet by teleconference or 
at face-to-face meetings for the purpose of discussing improvements or changes 
to the operation of the CCADB. Such discussions should not include 
competitively-sensitive information. 

### Customizing the CCADB ###

A Root Store Operator (Member) may make customization changes that only impact itself. 
Before being applied to the production instance of the CCADB, 
changes will be reviewed and tested by the CCADB Steering Committee, 
including to ensure that the changes will not negatively impact any of the 
other Members or the CCADB. The CCADB Steering Committee will either approve or decline 
the proposed changes. If the changes are approved, then the changes may be applied to the 
production instance of the CCADB. If the changes are denied, then the 
CCADB Steering Committee will 
provide an explanation, and the Member may submit the 
customizations again after addressing the feedback.

Members may request customization changes that impact shared data 
and interfaces. The CCADB Steering Committee will review, and approve or 
deny such requests. If the request is approved, the CCADB Steering Committee will prioritize the 
requested changes, and work with the Members to design and test the changes in 
a sandbox environment before applying them to the production instance of the 
CCADB.
