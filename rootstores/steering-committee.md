# CCADB Steering Committee #

The purpose of the CCADB Steering Committee (SC) is to collectively determine the direction and priorities for the Common CA Database (CCADB), and to share the workload of designing and testing updates to the CCADB. Additionally, the CCADB SC rotates responsibility for reviewing and processing data that is common to all of the root store members, such as CA certificates, policy documents, and audit statements.
