# CCADB Public Group #

The public@ccadb.org group was established to discuss topics related to Certification Authorities (CAs) and Root Store Programs who use the Common CA Database (CCADB). This page details the process and procedures for conducting discussion within the group as defined by the CCADB Steering Committee.

## CCADB Updates ##
An update to CCADB may include the addition of new functionality, the removal of previous functionality, or changes to the general availability of the system. A Root Store Member can post a message to public@ccadb.org to describe the type of update being made to CCADB.

## Root Store Program Announcements ##
The corresponding Root Store Member may post announcements related to their program in the public@ccadb.org group. The Root Store Member may describe what is changing or has changed with the program, link to supporting documentation, and any other information it feels should be communicated publicly.

## CCADB Policy Updates ##
The CCADB [policy](https://www.ccadb.org/policy) may be updated by the CCADB Steering Committee. A Root Store Member may post an update to the policy in the public@ccadb.org group. The Root Store Member may describe what is changing or has changed with the program, link to supporting documentation, and state the effective date of the change.

## Lessons Learned from CA Incident Reports ##
An important goal of incident reporting is to help all of us work together to build a more secure web. Therefore, [incident reports](https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA/Incident_Dashboard) should include lessons learned that could be helpful to all CAs to build better systems, and those lessons learned should be shared in the public@ccadb.org group.

## Root Inclusion Public Discussion ##
For those root stores that have public discussion, public@ccadb.org enables a single, shared public discussion phase for a CA owner applying to such Root Store Programs. The CCADB root inclusion public discussion process promotes openness and transparency for applicants to public root stores. However, Root Store Programs will make final inclusion decisions independently, on their own timelines, and based on each Root Store Member’s inclusion criteria.

### Prerequisites ###
Prior to a Root Store Member initiating a CCADB root inclusion public discussion, the following must occur:

1. A CA owner must have an account in CCADB
2. A completed 'Add/Update Root Request' case must exist in CCADB for the root CA certificate(s)
3. A 'Root Inclusion Request' case must have been submitted in CCADB, and one or more Root Store Members must be selected for inclusion

### Initiation ###
No more than three concurrent CCADB root inclusion public discussions shall take place at any given time. If more than three 'Root Inclusion Request' cases have been submitted in CCADB, any requests for replacing an existing root CA certificate in CCADB will be prioritized for public discussion. Otherwise, CCADB public discussion will generally occur on a first-ready, first-out basis (to be ready for discussion). 

A Root Store Member will initiate a six-week CCADB root inclusion public discussion in the public@ccadb.org group and provide information about the inclusion request from CCADB.

A CA owner is expected to respond to questions and concerns posted during the public discussion of their root CA certificate(s) inclusion request.

### Conclusion ###
At the end of the six-week period, the CCADB root inclusion public discussion may be continued by the Root Store Member to complete ongoing discussions or matters under investigation. If public discussion is continued, the Root Store Member will state the additional amount of time (in weeks) that the conversation may continue. Otherwise, the CCADB public discussion concludes.

The Root Store Member who initiated the public discussion provides a summary noting any objections or open questions that did not receive a response from the CA owner and states the public discussion period has concluded.

## Cross-Certificate Requests ##
Individual Root Store Program policies may require CA owners to notify public@ccadb.org before issuing a cross-certificate that can validate to a corresponding root CA certificate in the Root Store Member’s trust store. If required, the Root Store Program policy should stipulate the content required in the notification.
