# CCADB Usage Guidelines #

This page is intended for CA Owners who have requested and obtained access to the CCADB. We look forward to your help in keeping your CA’s data up-to-date in the CCADB, and ask that you follow these usage guidelines.

## CCADB Logins ##

Each CA Owner should:
* Consume less than 5 *daily-unique-logins* per month on average (i.e., one day per week).
  * There will be certain months in which you need to log in more frequently to update data regarding your CA, which is why we focus on average usage.
* Designate one individual who usually logs into the CCADB on the CA’s behalf.
  * An individual who has an account that can log in to the CCADB is called a Primary Point of Contact (POC) in the CCADB.
* Designate one or more backup individuals who can log in to the CCADB on the CA’s behalf when the primary individual is unavailable, with a maximum of 5 Primary POCs for each CA Owner.

Authentication to the CCADB’s production environment via the CCADB API consumes a license and counts towards the daily-unique-login numbers. Testing with the API should be done in the CCADB Sandbox environment so that it does not consume daily-unique-login numbers.

If your CA needs to consume more than 4 daily-unique-logins per month on average, then please notify support@ccadb.org to explain why.

We welcome you to add your ideas to [CCADB Public](https://groups.google.com/a/ccadb.org/g/public) about the information that you would like the CCADB to provide without requiring a login and how you would like to obtain that information.

**Daily-Unique-Login**
* A Primary POC logs into the CCADB via a Salesforce Community License. 
* Salesforce counts one login for each 24-hour period that a POC logs into the CCADB, which is referred to as daily-unique-login. 
* The CCADB Steering Committee member organizations are currently paying for a monthly allotment of daily-unique-logins for CAs.
* Salesforce follows a yearly entitlement policy to determine the number of used daily-unique-logins (i.e., our monthly allotment x 12), which resets annually on August 5.
