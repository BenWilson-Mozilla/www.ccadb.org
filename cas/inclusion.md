# Submit a Root Inclusion Request #

The "Root Inclusion Request" case is used by a CA Owner to request that one or more of their root CA certificates be included in one or more Root Store Programs.
* Instructions: [Create a Root Inclusion Request](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FHSbpNJ3CQOcpVqrj66elKQhTmpllp-IBsDovPy6cOo/edit#)

Root Store Member(s) review and process requests for inclusion in accordance with separate program requirements and within their own program timelines. The review process begins after a CA Owner has [added](https://www.ccadb.org/cas/updates) a root CA certificate to the CCADB and submitted a "Root Inclusion Request" to Root Store(s) for review.

Note: New required fields were added to CCADB Root Case records on December 22, 2022, and those fields will have to be populated in the "Root Inclusion Request‚Äù case to update a pre-existing Root Case record. Those fields will be in the applicable Root Program tab of the Root Inclusion Request case. CA Owners are expected to continue using the [Add/Update Root Request](https://www.ccadb.org/cas/updates) Case type to make necessary updates to CA Owner and Root Certificate records, such as policy and audit updates.
