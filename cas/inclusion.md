# Submit a Root Inclusion Request #

The 'Root Inclusion Request' case is used by a CA Owner to request that one or more of their root CA certificates be included in one or more Root Store Programs.

To **create a 'Root Inclusion Request' case** in the CCADB:
1. Click on the 'My CA' tab.
2. Click on the 'CASES' tab under the CA Owner’s name, near the top left corner of the page.
3. Click on the 'New' button, which is on the right side of the page, below the 'Get URLs' button.
4. Select 'Root Inclusion Request', and click on 'Next'.
5. Type in information for the 'Subject' (e.g., XYZ Root Certificates).
6. Click on the 'Save' button.
    * There will be a green bar shown across the top of the page, which says “Case ###### was created". Click on the number in the list below (the same which was provided by green bar) to view the new case.

* Detailed Instructions: [Create a Root Inclusion Request](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FHSbpNJ3CQOcpVqrj66elKQhTmpllp-IBsDovPy6cOo/edit#)

Root Store Operators review and process requests for inclusion in accordance with separate program requirements and within their own program timelines. The review process begins after a CA Owner has [added](https://www.ccadb.org/cas/updates) a root CA certificate to the CCADB and submitted a 'Root Inclusion Request' case to Root Store(s) for review.

Note: New required fields were added to CCADB Root Case records on December 22, 2022, and those fields will have to be populated in the 'Root Inclusion Request' case to update a pre-existing Root Case record. Those fields will be in the applicable Root Store Operator tab of the Root Inclusion Request case. CA Owners are expected to continue using the [Add/Update Root Request](https://www.ccadb.org/cas/updates) case type to make necessary updates to CA Owner and Root Certificate records, such as policy and audit updates.
