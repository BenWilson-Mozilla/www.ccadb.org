# Getting Started with the CCADB #

When you [login](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MuszDO2o-es_6-FwNCDWZ2TC979F8eil5bBQGKjaWRc/edit#heading=h.xpgou83dsc4m) 
to the CCADB you will see a row of tabs along the top 
of the window, next to the CCADB logo. The number of tabs that you
see depends on the width of your window, and a 'More' tab will
be shown when all of the tabs cannot be displayed. The tabs are:
'Home', 'My CA', 'CA Owners/Certificates', 'Cases', 'CA Communications', 
and 'Reports'.

**Home**: The home page is the initial page that you see when you login.
It provides your CA's task list which is a set of reports that may be openned
by clicking on their title.
* Open Cases
* Root Certificates with Outdated Audit Statements
* Intermediate Certificate with Outdated Audit Statements
* Intermediate Certificates with Missing Information
* Intermediate Certificates with Failed ALV Results
* etc.

Note: The CCADB considers the terms "intermediate" and "subordinate" synonymous.

**My CA**: Click on the 'My CA' tab to see the information that is in the CCADB
for your CA, a hierarachy of root certiicates and intermediate certificates,
and who the Points of Contact are for your CA.

**CA Owners/Certificates**: Click on the 'CA Owners/Certificates' tab 
(which may be under the 'More' tab) to see lists of certificates. 
* Click on 'Recently Viewed' in the upper left corner. 
* Select 'Community User's CA Owners/Root Certs'
then click on the thumb tack icon to pin this view as your default for this tab.

**Cases**: Click on the 'Cases' tab (which may be under the 'More' tab) to see 
lists of Cases.
* Click on 'Recently Viewed' in the upper left corner. 
* Select 'My Cases'
then click on the thumb tack icon to pin this view as your default for this tab.
    * '[Add/Update Root Request](updates)' cases are used for adding new root CA certificates or submitting annual updates.
    * '[Root Inclusion Request](inclusion)' cases are used for submitting requests for inclusion to Root Store Programs.
    * '[Add/Update Contacts](contacts)' cases are used to add or udpate POC information. 

**CA Communications**: The 'CA Communications' tab may be used when a Root
Store Operator polls CA Owners included in their program for information. You may ignore this tab
until you receive email from a Root Store Operator asking you to respond to
such a poll.

**Reports**: Click on the 'Reports' tab (which may be under the 'More' tab), 
then click on 'All Folders' along the left column, and then click on 
'CA Community Reports'.
