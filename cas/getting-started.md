## Navigating the Interface ##

Upon initial login you will see a row of tabs along the top 
of the window, next to the CCADB logo. The number of tabs that you
see depends on the width of your window, and a 'More' tab will
be shown when all of the tabs cannot be displayed. The tabs are:
'Home', 'My CA', 'CA Owners/Certificates', 'Cases', 'CA Communications', 
and 'Reports'.

**Home**: The home page is the initial page that you see when you login.
It provides contact information for root store members of the CCADB,
your CA's task list, and reports that you can expand when any of your task list
items are not 0.

**My CA**: Click on the 'My CA' tab to see the information that is in the CCADB
for your CA, a hierarachy of root certiicates and intermediate certificates,
and who the Points of Contact are for your CA.

**CA Owners/Certificates**: Click on the 'CA Owners/Certificates' tab 
(which may be under the 'More' tab), then click on 'Recently Viewed' in 
the upper left corner. Select 'Community User's CA Owners/Root Certs'
then click on the thumb tack icon to pin this view as your default for this tab.

**Cases**: Click on the 'Cases' tab (which may be under the 'More' tab), then 
click on 'Recently Viewed' in the upper left corner. Select 'My Cases'
then click on the thumb tack icon to pin this view as your default for this tab.
Audit Cases are used for submitting [annual updates](updates).

**CA Communications**: The 'CA Communications' tab may be used when a root
store operator polls their CA members for information. You may ignore this tab
until you receive email from a root store operator asking you to respond to
such a poll.

**Reports**: Click on the 'Reports' tab (which may be under the 'More' tab), 
then click on 'All Folders' along the left column, and then click on 
'CA Community Reports'.
