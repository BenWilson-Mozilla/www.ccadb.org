The Common CA Database (CCADB) is a repository of information about
externally operated Certificate Authorities (CAs) whose root and
intermediate certificates are included within 
the products and services of CCADB root store members.
Root store operators participate in the CCADB to improve security,
transparency, and interoperability.
The CCADB is used by a number of different
root store operators to manage their root stores, but it is run by
[Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org/mission/).
